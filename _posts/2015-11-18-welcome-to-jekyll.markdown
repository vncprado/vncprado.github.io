I'll try to start using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> + <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> pages for simplicity. Manage a server takes too much time. With jekyll I'll be able to have a small public thecnical blog without comrising my time which I baraly manage now.

I only have to understand now how to automatize this posts meta data. Probably will be easier then mantain a hole simple sistem like ghost.

Following below the original "Welcome to Jekyll!" post.

That's All!

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
